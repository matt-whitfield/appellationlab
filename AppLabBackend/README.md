# 🚀 Getting started with Strapi

Strapi comes with a full featured [Command Line Interface](https://docs.strapi.io/dev-docs/cli) (CLI) which lets you scaffold and manage your project in seconds.

## 🔧 Environment Setup

Before running the application, you need to set up your environment variables:

1. Copy the example environment file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Fill in your actual values in the `.env` file:
   - `APP_KEYS`: Generate secure app keys
   - `API_TOKEN_SALT`: Generate a secure salt for API tokens
   - `ADMIN_JWT_SECRET`: Generate a secure JWT secret for admin authentication
   - `TRANSFER_TOKEN_SALT`: Generate a secure salt for transfer tokens
   - `SENDGRID_API_KEY`: Your SendGrid API key for email functionality
   - `JWT_SECRET`: Generate a secure JWT secret
   - `PREVIEW_SECRET`: Generate a secure preview secret
   - `CLIENT_URL`: Your frontend application URL

3. For database configuration, uncomment and configure the database variables if using PostgreSQL in production.

⚠️ **Security Note**: Never commit your `.env` files to version control. They contain sensitive information that should be kept secret.
